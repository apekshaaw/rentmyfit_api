# RentMyFit
RentMyFit is a Flutter-based mobile marketplace that lets users browse, wishlist, and rent fashion items—clothing and shoes—directly from their phones. 
Consumers can create an account, explore curated products with multiple sizes, add favorites to a wishlist, and manage a shopping cart. 
An admin panel enables product management (add, edit, delete) and image uploads. 
Proximity and shake sensors provide quick theme switching and logout, delivering an interactive, seamless rental shopping experience.
